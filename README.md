## Summary

### Advantages and Disadvantages of refactoring a code
Some advantages of refactoring a code are that there already is a code to work with instead of starting from scratch and it also helps so a lot of different codes don’t have to be created for every single result. Refactoring also has some disadvantages such as doing something wrong in the code can affect your results especially when you’re not very familiar with it and more than likely a lot of the codes have already been used making in it harder when it’s time to run the macro 
### Application of Pros and Cons
The advantages and disadvantages apply because it was nice to not start the project from zero but also every time an error was made it was extremely hard to change it since the error messages are not very direct
